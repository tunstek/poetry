```
Love is a strange thing
It comes with just a smile
But I haven’t felt it for a while,
I remember the first -
She was clad all in black
With fiery red hair
When she arrived at my beck and call,
Even though we barely knew each other at all,
I had had a rough day
And she came and took it away
Although it wasn’t right
To hold her so tight -
She wasn’t mine you see,
And should not have been set free,
I still feel regret - he was a good friend -
And I was just a stupid kid
But I suppose I got what I deserved in the end -
When I got what I did.
