Strangers

I was a stranger to them
As they were strangers to me
But they were no strangers of each other
They and them and thee

It’s not as though I didn’t try
But I was only in the way
A hinderance to some agenda
That would not go away

Amongst the marble pillar filled dining halls
With paintings hung on massive walls
They drank from wood oak barrels of the finest wine
At white velvet tables on which to dine

And I hated them.
I hated all of them.
Scholars, philosophers; so-called ‘men of knowledge’
But ye know naught of me -
They, and them, and thee.
