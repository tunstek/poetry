```
Now I know why people pray
They pray for the things they can’t control,
The things where God really gets a say -
They pray for the crops not to fail,
So they don’t starve away
They pray for their family to see the sun rise,
Just to see another day
They pray for the souls of their beloved that passed before,
So they may rest peacefully in paradise
So they’re not tormented by the devil forever;
In eternal demise.
```
