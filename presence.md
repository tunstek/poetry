```
Presence

The images of your mind are falsities.
They are clean and ideal and certain -
Far from reality.
Yet you let them determine yours
You sweat - you feel ill
Not for what is real
But for the creations that fill your mind
You experience these things because
You are not in the now
You are somewhere else
Somewhere that does not exist
The present, it brings no sense of dread
For whatâ€™s to come next
The moment bares no falsities
Of that ideal perfection in your head
It is as true as you are here
As true as dawn will come
As true as dusk will disappear.
```

### About
The Taoists speak of a 'flow state', a state where you are 100% in the present. I believe that anxiety is rooted in a lack of presence in the moment. You are thinking about other things, things that could be (and will likely never be). The good will come, along with the bad, worrying about it will bring you nothing but anxiety. Just let go and exist in the now. After all, this is what's real.

I refer to 'here' as right now, presently reading this poem, where ever that may be.
