```
Do you think the dead envy us?

Do you think the dead can touch,
The flowing fresh waters of a spring stream -
The feathers from an eagles wing

Do you think the dead can hear,
The birds of the morning, sing so dear
Or choirs with their angels near

Do you think the dead can see,
Sunsets on a summers eve
And butterflies floating in the breeze

Do you think the dead can taste,
The wild raspberries that come out late
Or beef and potatoes, stewed without haste

Do you think the dead can smell,
The blooming roses we knew so well
Or the forest where the trees were fell

Do you think the dead can feel,
All these things that are so real:
Love and loss and loneliness -
Do you think the dead, envy us?
