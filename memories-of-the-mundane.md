```
The memories of the mundane
They flow to and fro
Of simple things of the everyday;
Like rooms once visited,
In houses far away

Bedside night lamps, posters on walls
With little curtains drawn
Bracelets and books and pens and all
I know what I remember - it persists -
The only place you could call your own,
Now no longer exists.
```
