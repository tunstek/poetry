```
Will it snow for Christmas?
No, not here; not this year.
What about there? Where you are?
It will? 
I bet it’ll be pretty.
Especially at night.
You’ll have to wear your hat and gloves
To get home, all warm and snug.
I won’t be there this year.
Next year neither.
In fact - I’m not sure I’ll ever,
Make it back.
