```
On a cold brisk night
In late December,
A night I hardly thought I’d remember,
We - you and I -
Went searching for lights in the night,
You drove, you knew the spot,
While I kept watch

We made it just in time
With a couple minutes to spare
Enough to find our vantage point
From where we’d watch the flight
Of little rockets into the air
That cracked and banged and lit up the night

We could see the whole city from there
Each and every light
And every crack and bang of celebration,
It filled us with elation
I remember as I watched the colours flicker,
Thinking about how we’d stay together

When we got home, things felt different
And you seemed distant
Perhaps it was then that you knew
On that late New Years hue -
Of someone new.
