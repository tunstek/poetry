Autumn Oranges

The paths of life, they vary in between
Autumn oranges and Summer green
Some are fluffy and light with snow
Others like mirrors as waters flow
Some shine brightly throughout the night
And some change swiftly without sleight
Others fall and twist and turn
And know no end, and may even return
Back down a path, whence you came
Now but a shadow, of the same name
```

### About
'Autumn Oranges' is more beautiful than 'Cellar Door' IMO.

This, along with `memories` will form part of a future 'Czech Collection'.
