Limbo

It’s difficult to describe
An emptiness, deep down inside
A hollowness in time
An inescapable nothingness
Without start, or end, or sign

There exists no path in front of me,
Or even one behind
It seems - just - but a moment ago,
When I stood the test of time
```

### About
I'm not usually a fan of stream of consciousness type of poetry but the following is something that has grown on me.
Written while I wrote Limbo, I think of it as a kind of Limbo B-Side. Perhaps it gives a little more context to Limbo too.

```
How can I just take this feeling I feel now
And bottle it up?
With a label and cap and colour and all
A deathly dullness that’d be sure to wipe the shine from a shimmering sea on a summers eve
Or dampen the warming glow of a campfire by night
With one swift swig

I’d bottle all such things
Each more potent than the last
So I could say: ‘Look! See? These are the things I have felt, are you acquainted?
Have you not a soul?’
```
