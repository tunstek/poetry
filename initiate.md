Initiate

The stranger entered,
Followed close behind
By his self declared sponsor
‘Welcome to our humble lodge, initiate.
You know what we do,
We help those in need
And give the poor their stew.
Now, let us lay some ground rules’

The initiate focused intently,
As I spoke he seemed nervous
Of course, I only said what needed to be said
And only what his ears could comprehend

‘Are you ready for your initiation?’
‘I am’
‘Does your sponsor wish to pledge for you?’
‘I do’
‘Very well, seek not the darkness of the light
Now enter the passage, to take your rite’
I pointed the stranger towards the initiates chamber
Candle lit, and wrought with dying ember -
This is a night he’ll surely remember
