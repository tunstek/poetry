```
My grand uncle took a fall
In a shed down the road
Long ago
He was earning his keep
To pay for his bread and board
When suddenly he took a turn -
He collapsed and fell
And hit his head on a churn

I took a turn the other day too
Just keeled over
And broke my teeth on the tiled floor
I remember the sound of them breaking
And waking up as though I never slept at all
Alone, drenched in sweat with blood all over,
‘Twas quite the fall
‘Could have been worse.’ Told my father
‘Could have been killed -
Like your grand uncle was.’
