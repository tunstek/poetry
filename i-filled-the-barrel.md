I Filled The Barrel

There is a beautiful corner in my garden
Underneath a giant apple tree that was planted by my great grandfather
The sun casts its shadow just right on summer evenings
And the birds love to perch and sing their tunes in the mornings -
‘Twas the perfect spot
I could scarcely think of any other

So one morning
I pulled over a large barrel
And placed it under the tree
Above, clusters of apples where beginning to grow
And the birds, they sang their tunes to me
I placed a water pipe in the barrel and turned on the tap
As I watched the water flow
Scarcely did I know,
For I had forgotten to visit a relative
Many miles from home!

I had called to the rest,
So far as I could remember,
And I gave them all my best -
The barrel was full
It’s too late now,
I’m sure they’ll know I loved them
I turned off the tap
And caught my reflection in the water -
I’ve said my goodbyes now
There’s no going back
For I wish to see my daughter
She is there, in the water
I see her staring back at me
She beckons me to my peril
I dove in, head first -
And I filled the barrel.
