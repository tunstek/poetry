```
Is it a curse?
It feels as though it is -
I was told that one exists -
It’s like the whole world is against me
For no other reason than just to be
Never, not anything, that ever graced my head
Not once has it ever transpired, or even came and went
I wonder is it a good thing?
It keeps me on my toes, I suppose
But ohh how it sucks -
It makes me want to just give up
To pack it in and say “enough’s enough"
Maybe I’ve been blind to the opportunities I’ve been given
Maybe I just haven’t done enough to deserve a living
I feel I work hard, I do what I can;
But maybe I just never, became a man.
```
