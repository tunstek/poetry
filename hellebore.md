Hellebore

Why do I lie here waiting?
All these nights abating
For something that will never come
But must be found abound with rum

My courage is not retaining
And these sights, they are awaiting
A gentle hand with band combined
A noble maiden to free my mind

Until one day, when trumpets sound
And all can gleam and glisten aloud
I will remember forever more,
My gentle maiden of the name Lenore

But one may not see nor hear
As serpents and seraphs disappear
Into a place we all know well;
The darkest depths of hell

My love has turned to poison
My heart resides therein
I cannot face the winter wind
Nor rid the world of sin
```

### About
This is the first poem I ever really 'fleshed out', so to speak. The term 'hellebore' refers to a family of flowers which are sometimes termed 'winter rose' but are not actually related to the rose family (in a way, they are 'fake'). They are also poisonous.

I'm a huge fan of Poe and Frost. I think `Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening` is one of the greatest poems ever written. At the time I wanted to replicate the effect Frost gets with the line `'The woods are lovely, dark and deep'` (which I was obsessed with at the time) with the line `'The darkest depths of hell'` but of course I failed miserably. I'll happily admit that the second and third stanzas may be slightly cringe, but I was going for a crescendo of 'happiness'/'joy'/'cringe'/whatever you want to call it, right before the fall.
