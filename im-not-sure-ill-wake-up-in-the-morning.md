```
I’m not sure I’ll wake up in the morning
Perhaps my heart will seize
Or my brain, bleed
Looking back, would I have done things different?
Maybe not, but who’s to say?
There were many forks along the way
Many twists and turns and lefts and rights
You might think you have free choice -
But sometimes these paths, well they choose you
And really, there’s not so much
One can do.
