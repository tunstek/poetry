```
â€˜Twas late one quiet night
I lay alone, fast asleep
In my bed without a peep
But far away,
Demons prayed
In dungeons down below
Dimly lit and scarcely ever shown
Brewing chaos none could know

They wanted something of mine
That I held deep inside
Not just me but all men of mind
They wished to take it for themselves
This strength of men, was strength for them
Most give it up voluntarily, but I would not -
So they sent their minions after me
Who came for me in my dreams

I could not win, I had no chance
I had no faith, in God nor man.
