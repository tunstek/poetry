Acquaintance

The day was dark and fading
My mind, cold and numb
The air around was dull and sour
And in my hand, a bottle of rum

When then I heard a knocking at the door
Tap; tap tap
Who might this be at such late an hour?
Perhaps a fellow brother in distress?

Tis a stranger, and nothing more;
'I walk a path of darkness' says he
'And have come to seek the light'
'I bare no light to offer thee
Go home and be set free'

'He is safe, fellow brother' came a voice from within
'For I vouch for him'
'I trust you know what this entails, should you wish to keep your limb'
'I do' says he

'Very well' says I; 'come in'
