A Fist In The Air

How can an adult ever teach children
About things they’ve never seen?
Poverty, famine; true equality
They must have been brought up on the idea,
Perhaps they even read about it
And that makes them experts in their field
Just so long as no one can question,
Their silly ideals

‘It’s never been done in practice,
It’s never been done correct’
‘Everyone will get their say this way,
When the statues are no longer erect’
‘The system must be, reduced to rubble,
Freedom can’t persist,
So we can build a better place,
A place of mass arrests’

Mass arrests indeed
And I hope you’re the first to go
Brought down to the gulag;
Forced to mine the coal
Down there you’ll get your wish
It’ll come, fast and swift
A world where everyone is equal;
Equally starved and missed.
