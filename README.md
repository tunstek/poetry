## Introduction
Here lies a collection of my 'finished' poems. I've tried not to make them too personal but inevitably there's always a personal side. I have a rather poor memory so some of them here do describe personal memories I'd rather not forget. But I hope, nonetheless, that someone may relate to them in some way.

If you like them, or have any constructive feedback, I'd like to know what you think: keith.tunstead@gmail.com

## Open Source Poetry???
Why not? I'm open to pull requests.
