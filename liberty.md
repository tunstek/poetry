Liberty

Two plus two is four,
Three by three is nine;
The road below is short until,
Two plus two is five

‘Beware!’ Posted signs of warning,
Scattered all along
‘Danger to those who do not heed!
For Freedom and Liberty cannot save you,
In these awful times of need!’

‘Come forth brother!
We shall feed and clothe and bathe you!
You shall not be afraid!
Set aside that pesky Freedom,
For it’s only in the way!’

The road was paved with bodies,
Skeletons and bones;
Of those who died along the way,
Hungry and alone

Men, women and children
Once pure of spirit and mind;
Doubtless with good intentions,
Of the highest kind

Do not give up your liberty
For safety promised in kind,
The tyrants will not help you
When two plus two is five.
