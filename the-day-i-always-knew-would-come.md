```
The day I always knew would come
Was coloured in grey
Like any other day
The seeds of unrest had been sown
Still yet to grow
Unsettled not
By the winding clock
And tick; and tick; and tock;

Tick; tick; tick;
Said the clock;
Tick; and tick; and tock;

No signs did this day show
No sigh nor cry nor whimper
No faith had I to bestow
For I was merely cinder
And yet unsettled not
By the beating of the clock,
And tick; and tick; and tock;

Tick; tick; tick;
Cried the clock;
Tick; tick; tock;

That dreadful sound
It filled my head to the brim
The beating knew no end
And chaos seemed within
Would it go on forever more?
Not with mercy much longer could I implore

And then that moment, it finally came -
And all was suddenly silent;
A flower blossomed from my bosom
And then my heart was still:
Tick; tick; tock.

### About
The second poem I ever wrote and I truly hope it will be the darkest poem I ever write. The timing here is important as I attempt to build, not so much suspense, but an uneasiness as you read. My aim was for the ticking to become unbearably monotonous for the reader also.

Perhaps the ticking of clocks is a little clich√© but I feel (perhaps wrongly) that it establishes what I wanted to achieve.

If you require help or have suicidal thoughts, please please please reach out to someone. There is someone in your life that cares, even if you think there isn't.
