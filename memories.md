Memories

Days fade to memories, in the fall of light
Then to dreams, in the dark of night
They are now, ohh so old
Did they happen? Or were they told?
Now only in my mind they exist
No one to share, no one to miss

I cannot paint a picture; or even write a song
Of these memories, so dear and strong
Of sunsets over cities, and lights so bright
Of autumn evenings, and summer kites
Of winter walks in silky snow
Were they only dreams? I do not know.

If you have memories of events, but no one who shares them, how can you be so sure they ever even happened?
